# 9. Project-Specific Security Controls

Each mobile application is unique, so a one-size-fits-all approach doesn't work for mobile security. Therefore, additional sections should be added to the checklist to cover project-specific security controls and features.

This section can include requirements related to a non-native platform or programming language, in case the app doesn't adhere strictly to native iOS and Android frameworks. It can also cover requirements specific to the app's domain or industry. Additionally, if the app needs to comply with certain standards or regulations, their requirements can be included here.
